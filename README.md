# NLP-of-Amazon-Reviews

1. I have utilised sqlite format of dataste for NLP and EDA. The dataset can be dowloaded from this link:
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews
2. The dataset was initially cleaned and de-duplication was performed to remove redundant data.
3. The NLP was performed using these approches:
    a) Bag of Words
    b) TF-IDF
    c) Avearge Word2Vec
    d) Word2Vec with TF-IDF
4. The project can be taken 1 step ahead. After the NLP was performed, we can build a classifier from the given dataset and the performace of the the model can be tested with "score" column.
